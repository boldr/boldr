Boldr
====

> Your dreams are bold. Your thoughts are bold. So why shouldn't your CMS be a little, **Boldr**?

Boldr aims to provide a CMS to use as a base for your next web project. Built on cutting edge
web technologies, along with a few time tested favorites, we believe Boldr could become something
special. Of course the world doesn't need another never finished CMS project, nor does it need
the "next WordPress". Boldr tries to be none of that.
