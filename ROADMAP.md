# Roadmap

Initially, Boldr was kept under my personal Github. The move to a separate Boldr organization made the most sense because this isnt about one person. 

For a short period of time, I had the API and CMS living in different repositories under the Boldr organization. This is no longer the case. I believe using a monorepo provides a better developer experience, especially while the contributor team is small. A monorepo approach also allows users to file issues in a single place. Dependencies are easier to keep up to date. The downside is the list dependencies looks large. Many of these are small packages, but the goal will be to reduce the amount of dependencies as we progress.

### Now until 0.5.0

**Continuing on the path toward stability**. I want to get what is currently working and/or semi-working to be stable.


### 0.5.0+
